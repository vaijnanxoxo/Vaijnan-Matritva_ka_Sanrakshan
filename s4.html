<h2>JANNI SURAKSHA YOJNA(JSY)</h2>
<div class="main">
<p>JSY is a scheme supported and funded by the Government of India. It was launched on 12 April 2005 by the Prime Minister of India. Its aim is to decrease the neo-natal and maternal deaths happening in the country by promoting institutional delivery of babies. It is a 100% centrally sponsored scheme it integrates cash assistance with delivery and post-delivery care. The success of the scheme would be determined by the increase in institutional delivery among the poor families. Under the scheme ASHA activists have been assigned the responsibility to encourage the people in the rural areas for institutional delivery, with particular focus on poor women. Under the scheme, the states with low rate of Institutional deliveries are classified as 'Low Performing States(LPS)' which include Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Rajasthan, Orissa and Jammu and Kashmir, whereas the remaining states are termed as High Performing States(HPS)</p>
