	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>Vaijnan is an initiative started by a group of four students who were devastated  by the maternal health care services provided in the rural areas. They thought of improving the services by organizing free health check up centers, assisted by well known doctors.
    A website named vaijnan has been designed which provides them with the information like why is it important, how can it be improved, what are the consequences of lack of maternal health.
    The website is easily available to the people those who live in rural areas. We even have our individuals as volunteers who guide them.
